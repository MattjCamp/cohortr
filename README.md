# Cohort R Package

## Read Me

cohortr helps you get insight into educational cohorts. This package includes
lookup functions for WICHE, US States and other
information needed for cohort analysis.

cohortr contains a SQL based grammer that works with databases to provide reusable 
procedures to create statistical tables. The verbs in this grammer are functions that 
encapsulate the filters, joins and transformations required to quickly and reliably retrieve 
information about educational cohorts.

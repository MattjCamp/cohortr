# WICHE

You can use the `wiche` table to join to your cohort to 
get participation rates or to otherwise see enrollments of
students by state. Here is what the first 10 rows of the
`wiche` table looks like:

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = "hide"}

library(dplyr)
library(cohortr)

wiche

```

`r knitr::kable(wiche[1:10,])`

You can do a quick lookup with the `lookup_wiche` function. Here
is how to see the enrollments for 8th and 9th graders in Pennsylvania
and New Jersey:

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = "hide"}

lookup_wiche(location = c("pa", "nj"),
             grade = c(8, 9))

```

`r knitr::kable(lookup_wiche(location = c("pa", "nj"),
             grade = c(8, 9)))`
